# Virtual-Mouse
Using AI and Python, we made the virtual mouse.
During the pandemic it as advised to not touch high contact surfaces which
can lead to the spread of the virus. Thus, the proposed model provides a
viable solution that can be used to control personal computers and tablet
computers which have a web camera attached to them and can perform
almost all mouse operations.
It will serve as aN alternative/backup if the touchpad or mouse aren' t
functioning.
Moist, sweaty or calloused fingers can disrupt the signals picked up by the
sensors. This system will assist in preventing that.
